## Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

Generally speaking, in this Webinar we are going to learn that Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning.

In order to know the important things of these areas of Artificial Intelligence we we need to understand concepts
such as:

* Definitions, Approaches and Algorithms of Machine Learning

* Definitions, Neural Networks, Architectures of Deep Learning.
