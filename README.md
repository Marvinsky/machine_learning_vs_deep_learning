## Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

In this webinar we are going to learn that Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning. In addition, in order
to get precise predictions in Machine Learning we need to adjust our models manually, which is different in deep
learning where we create a neural network and it starts learning by itself.
